/**
 Provides methods which interacts with the JasperReports Server REST API. The 
 object puts at disposal a set of methods for sending JSRequests for different 
 API parts, different types of cancel request(s). To send a proper request to
 server JSRequest instance should be configured. For this purposes JSRESTResource, 
 JSRESTReport helper classes was provided which do all this configuration in easier
 way for specific API parts (i.e. repository, reports etc.)
 @todo Provide helper classes for job and administration services
