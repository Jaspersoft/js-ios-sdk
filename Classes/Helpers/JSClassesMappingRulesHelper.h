/**
 @cond EXCLUDE_JS_CLASSES_MAPPING_RULES_HELPER
 
 Loads and represents as dictionary data from <b>ClassesMappingRules.plist</b> file.
 This file (can be found by path /Classes/Helpers/MappingConfiguration/) contains
 classes mapping rules (all classes from <b>ObjectMappings</b> group).
 
 Class mapping rule describes how returned HTTP response (in JSON, XML and other
 formats) should be mapped directly to this class (i.e. describes how XML should
 be mapped to JSResourceDescriptor, JSReportDescriptor etc.)
