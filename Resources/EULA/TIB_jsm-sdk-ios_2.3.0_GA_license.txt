Each party agrees to indemnify the other for any damages (including reasonable expenses) the other may sustain resulting from a breach of this Section and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for a breach of confidentiality. The parties are entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief under this clause without the necessity of posting a bond even if otherwise normally required. Such injunctive or equitable relief shall not be the exclusive remedy for any breach of confidentiality, but is in addition to all other rights and remedies
available at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Licensor's source code shall be kept confidential in perpetuity. Affiliates of either party are included in the definition of "Licensor" and "Customer", respectively, for purposes of this Section entitled "Confidentiality". Confidential Information remains the sole property of the disclosing party, and each party acknowledges and agrees that it does not acquire any rights therein. Use by a recipient of Confidential Information for the purposes contemplated under the Agreement, including, but not limited to, any configuration or use by Customer of the Software or Materials, does not affect or diminish the disclosing party's rights, title and interest in and to Confidential Information.

8. Additional Customer Obligations.

Licensor assumes no responsibility and accepts no liability for the protection, loss, destruction or maintenance of Customer's data even though Licensor may from time to time recommend daily system back-up and verification procedures. (b) Customer shall provide Licensor with good faith cooperation and access to such information, facilities, personnel and equipment as may be reasonably required by Licensor in order to perform its obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to, providing security access, information, and software interfaces to
Customer's applications.

assignment for the benefit of creditors. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement or an Order Form, Customer must cease using, de-install and permanently delete all of the applicable Software; whether or not modified or merged into other materials. Termination of this Agreement or any Order Form shall not limit either party from pursuing other remedies available to it, including injunctive relief, nor shall such termination relieve Customer of its obligation to pay all fees that have accrued or are otherwise owed by Customer under this Agreement. 
17. Suspension. Licensor will be entitled to suspend any or all Software Services, Maintenance and/or Consulting Services upon 10 days written notice to Customer in the event Customer is in breach of this Agreement.

Licensor will provide Customer advance notice of any such suspension at Licensor's reasonable discretion based on the nature of the circumstances giving rise to the suspension. Licensor will use reasonable efforts to re-establish the affected Software Services promptly after Licensor determines, in its reasonable discretion, that the situation giving rise the suspension has been cured by Customer. Licensor may terminate the Software Services if any of the foregoing causes of suspension remain
uncured by Customer. If Software Services are terminated by Licensor due to the foregoing, Licensor shall either provide Customer with or allow Customer access sufficient to retrieve all Customer's Output in comma separated value (CSV) format. Customer shall pay Licensor for its work resolving the situation giving rise to the suspension on a T&M basis, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
18. General Provisions
(a) All notices required under this Agreement shall be in writing. Notices will be effective if dispatched by facsimile; or electronic mail; by hand; reliable overnight delivery service or first-class, pre-paid mail if sent to the contract address for the intended recipient set forth in an Order Form. A copy of any notice of default, breach or termination shall also being sent to that party's General Counsel. 
(b) The losing party shall pay all reasonable costs, including, without limitation attorney's fees, incurred by the prevailing party in any action brought to enforce the prevailing party's rights under this Agreement. 
(c) This Agreement shall not be interpreted to create an agency or consignment relationship, and neither party is a partner, employee, agent or joint venture partner of, or with, the other. 
(d) During the term of any Order Form and for a period of one (1) year following expiration or termination of an Order Form, neither party shall actively solicit for employment any employee, contractor, or consultant, or other representative of the other party who performed services in connection with the applicable Order Form, without the prior written consent of the other party. 
(e) Licensor may designate any agent or subcontractor to perform such tasks and functions to complete any services covered under this Agreement. However, nothing in the preceding sentence shall relieve Licensor from responsibility for performance of its duties under the terms of this Agreement. 
(f) During the term of any Order Form and for a period of one (1) year following expiration or termination of an Order Form, Customer hereby grants Licensor and its independent auditors, at Licensor's expense, the right to audit Customer's compliance with this Agreement upon ten (10) days' notice and at reasonable times and to report any results to Licensor's licensors. Customer shall at no cost to Licensor (i) provide any assistance reasonably requested by Licensor or its designee in conducting any such audit, including installing and operating audit software, (ii) make requested personnel, records, and information available to Licensor or its designee, and (iii) in all cases, provide such assistance, personnel, records, systems access and information in an expeditious manner to facilitate the timely completion of such compliance verification. Customer's failure to comply with the provisions of this section will constitute a material breach of this Agreement. If the audit reveals any noncompliance, Customer
shall reimburse Licensor for the reasonable costs and expenses of the audit (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees), and Customer shall promptly cure any such noncompliance; provided, however, that the obligations under this section do not constitute a waiver of Licensor's termination rights and do not affect Licensor's right to payment for Software, Software Services or Materials related to usage in excess of the Number of Units.

No delay or default in performance of any obligation by either party (except payment obligations), shall constitute a breach of the Agreement to the extent caused by force majeure or any other cause which is beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, fires, strikes, accidents, or acts of God. 
(i) Except for an assignment, in whole or part, by Licensor to an Affiliate, neither party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, and/or any of its rights and/or obligations without the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). Any such attempted assignment shall be void. For the purposes of the foregoing, a change in control of Customer is deemed to cause or attempt to cause an assignment of the Agreement, in whole or part, and shall require Licensor's prior written consent. 
(j) To the extent Customer or its successors or assigns enters into an Extraordinary Corporate Event after an Order Form Effective Date, those users, divisions or entities, which were added to or divested from Customer's organization as a result of the Extraordinary Corporate Event are not authorized to use the Software or Materials until those users, divisions or entities are added to this Agreement by way of a written amendment signed by duly authorized officers of the Licensor and Customer, or in the case of a divesture, the divested entity. 
(k) This Agreement is for the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns, and does not confer any rights or benefits on any third party, including any employee of a party, any client of a party, or any employee of a client of a party.

Otherwise, the Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Federal Court for the Northern District Court of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to this Agreement. 
(n) If any sentence, clause or other provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, including, but not limited to, any limitation of liability, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining clauses and provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby. The affected provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to render it enforceable while attempting to closely approximate the intent and the economic effect of the affected provision.
19. Agreement Structure and Scope.
(a) Order of precedence. To the extent any terms and conditions of the Master Terms or Supplemental Terms conflict with the terms and conditions of additional license requirements or notices contained in the Documentation, then such license requirements or notices pertaining to Third Party Software included with the Software, shall control. To the extent any terms and conditions of these Master Terms conflict with the Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms shall control. To the extent the Order Form conflicts with the Master Terms or Supplemental Terms, the Order Form shall control. 
(b) Entire Agreement. The Agreement constitutes the parties' entire agreement relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, agreements, requests for proposals, proposals, conditions, representations, and warranties, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter. No modification to the Agreement will be binding unless in writing and includes a signature by an authorized representative of each party, except in the case of an Order Form where Licensor's acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on Licensor's initial delivery of products or services under the Order Form. All pre-printed or standard terms of any Customer purchase order or other business processing document shall have no effect.
