2. Maintenance.  Licensor will deliver Maintenance  subject to the terms at https://terms.tibco.com/posts/845633-maintenance unless otherwise set forth in an Order Form.  
3. Consulting Services.  Customer may procure Consulting Services under an Order Form. Unless otherwise expressly agreed in an Order Form, all Consulting Services will be: (a) performed on a time and materials basis ("T&M"), with meals, lodging, travel and other reasonably necessary out-of-pocket expenses, such as hardware and software acquired by Licensor to support the project ("Expenses"), invoiced in addition to T&M fees, (b) deemed accepted upon delivery, and (c) owned by and remain the confidential information of Licensor, excluding Customer’s Confidential Information.
4. Fees.  The effectiveness of these Terms or any Order Form is subject to the payment of all applicable fees.  Unless otherwise agreed, Customer shall pay any fees and related charges set forth in an Order Form or which otherwise come due, net thirty (30) days from Licensor's invoice. A service charge of one and one-half percent per month (or such lower amount as permitted by applicable law) will be applied to all fees and charges that are not paid on time.  Customer agrees to pay all sales, use, value-added, goods and services, consumption, withholding, excise and any other similar taxes or government charges, exclusive of Licensor’s income taxes. Except as set forth in the “Termination” or "Remedies" section, all fees and charges paid under or in connection with these Terms are non-refundable and no right of set off exists.  Licensor does not permit aggregation of products, services, purchase or license models or cumulative fees paid across separate Product Lines to trigger preferred pricing or discounts.
5. Proprietary Notices.  Licensor Software, Materials, and Documentation are proprietary to Licensor and its licensors and protected by applicable U.S. and international patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws.  Licensor and its licensors shall retain ownership in the Licensor Software, Materials and Documentation, all derivatives thereof, and any intellectual property or other rights embodied therein. All proprietary notices incorporated in or affixed to any Licensor Software, Materials and Documentation, must be duplicated by Customer on all copies of the Licensor Software, Materials and Documentation, as applicable, and must not be altered, removed or obliterated. Except as stated herein, Customer receives no other rights to use any of Licensor's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features. 
6. Confidentiality.  “Confidential Information” means any information disclosed by either party, whether or not marked, including, without limitation, the provisions of these Terms and any Order Form, the Licensor Software, Materials, individual contact information provided by either party or related performance test results derived by Customer, including but not limited to benchmark test results, Protected Data and Output. Each party agrees to protect Confidential Information in the same manner as it protects its own (but using no less than a reasonable degree of protection) and may only disclose Confidential Information to those with a need to know that information and who have agreed in writing to be bound by terms at least as protective as those contained in these Terms.

Each party agrees to indemnify the other for any damages (including reasonable expenses) the other may sustain resulting from the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of the other's Confidential Information and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for a breach of confidentiality. The parties are entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief without the necessity of posting a bond even if otherwise normally required. Such injunctive or equitable relief shall not be the exclusive remedy for any breach of confidentiality, but is in addition to all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Licensor’s source code shall be kept confidential in perpetuity. Affiliates of either party are included in the definition of “Licensor” and “Customer”, respectively, for purposes of this Section entitled “Confidentiality”.  Confidential Information remains the sole property of the disclosing party, and each party acknowledges and agrees that it does not acquire any rights therein. Use by a recipient of Confidential Information for the purposes contemplated under these Terms, including, but not limited to, any configuration or use by Customer of the Licensor Software or Materials, does not affect or diminish the disclosing party’s rights, title and interest in and to Confidential Information.
7. Data Protection and Security Plan. To the extent Licensor is exposed to an individual’s Protected Data, Licensor agrees to maintain a data protection and security plan. 
8. Warranties.

Furthermore, Licensor will indemnify and hold Customer harmless from and against any damages, costs and fees reasonably incurred (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that are attributable to such claim or action and which are assessed against Customer in a final judgment (“Indemnity”).  Licensor’s obligations to defend, settle or indemnify Customer are subject to Customer promptly notifying Licensor in writing of such claim; Licensor having the exclusive right to control such defense and/or settlement; and Customer providing reasonable assistance (at Licensor's expense) in the defense thereof.

15. Government Use.  If the Licensor Software, Software Services, Documentation, Materials and any other Licensor services are being or have been acquired with U.S. Federal Government funds, or Customer is an agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government ("Government"), the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer of the Licensor Software, Software Services, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data, manuals or Materials, is restricted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian agencies and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military agencies.

16. Termination.   Either party may terminate: (a) these Terms and/or any or all applicable Order Forms upon thirty (30) days prior written notice if the other party breaches a material provision of these Terms or an Order Form and fails to cure such breach within the thirty (30) day notice period; (b) Maintenance, upon prior written notice at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of any annual Maintenance period; (c) an Order Form for Consulting Services, upon fifteen (15) days prior written notice by Customer or thirty (30) days prior written notice by Licensor; (d) Subscription, upon written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Subscription Term.  These Terms and all Order Forms shall automatically terminate if either party files for bankruptcy, goes into receivership, becomes insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Upon termination or expiration Customer must cease using, de-install and permanently delete all of the Licensor Software; whether or not modified or merged into other materials.  Termination of these Terms, any Licensor Software license, any Software Services, Subscription or any Order Form shall not limit either party from pursuing other remedies available to it, including injunctive relief, nor shall such termination relieve Customer of its obligation to pay all fees that have accrued or are otherwise owed by Customer under these Terms.  
17. General Provisions. 
 Additional license requirements and other license notices, if any, shall be contained in the Documentation that is delivered with the applicable Licensor Software.  Unless expressly authorized by such terms, Customer agrees not to use or access any third-party software as a stand-alone product or in any other manner other than in connection with the Licensor Software. 
  All notices related to these Terms shall be in writing. Notices will be effective if dispatched by facsimile; or electronic mail; by hand; reliable overnight delivery service or first-class, pre-paid mail if sent to the contract address for the intended recipient set forth in an Order Form. A copy of any notice of default, breach or termination shall also be sent to that party's General Counsel.
 The losing party shall pay all reasonable costs, including, without limitation attorneys’ fees, incurred by the prevailing party in any action brought to enforce the prevailing party’s rights under these Terms. 
 The Terms shall not be interpreted to create an agency or consignment relationship, and neither party is a partner, employee, agent or joint venture partner of, or with, the other.  During the term of any Order Form and for a period of one (1) year following expiration or termination of an Order Form, neither party shall actively solicit for employment any employee, contractor, or consultant, or other representative of the other party who performed services in connection with the applicable Order Form, without the prior written consent of the other party.
 Customer hereby grants Licensor and its independent auditors, at Licensor's expense, the right to audit Customer‘s compliance with these Terms upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times and to report any results to Licensor’s licensors. Customer agrees to provide assistance to ensure a complete and accurate audit by Licensor and its independent auditors.  Customer’s failure to comply with the provisions of this section will constitute a material breach of these Terms.
 No waiver by either party of any breach of any provision of these Terms shall be construed as a waiver of that or any other provision on any other occasion.
 Dates or times by which one party is required to perform under these Terms shall be postponed automatically for so long as that party is prevented from performing by any act of or failure to act by, the other party.  No delay or default in performance of any obligation by either party (except payment obligations), shall constitute a breach of these Terms to the extent caused by force majeure or any other cause which is beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, fires, strikes, accidents, or acts of God.
 Except for an assignment, in whole or part, by Licensor to a wholly owned subsidiary, neither party may assign these Terms and/or any of its rights and/or obligations without the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). Any such attempted assignment shall be void. For the purposes of the foregoing, a change in control of Customer is deemed to cause or attempt to cause an assignment of these Terms and shall require Licensor’s prior written consent.
 To the extent Customer or its successors or assigns enters into an Extraordinary Corporate Event after an Order Form Effective Date, these Terms, as amended, shall not apply to those additional users, divisions or entities, which were added to or divested from Customer’s organization as a result of the Extraordinary Corporate Event until those additional users, divisions or entities are added to these Terms by way of a written amendment signed by duly authorized officers of the Licensor and Customer.
 The parties' rights and obligations under this section and sections entitled "Fees", “Warranties”, “Indemnity”, “Remedies”, “Disclaimers”, “Exclusions”, “Limitation of Liability”, “Proprietary Notices”, "Confidentiality", "General" shall survive the expiration or termination of these Terms.
 If Customer is entering into these Terms from a European Union member country, Norway, Switzerland, Japan, India or Australia, then these Terms are governed by the laws of England and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.  Otherwise, these Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Federal Court for the Northern District Court of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to these Terms.
 These Terms, which hereby incorporate by reference any terms or information contained in a URL or referenced policy, together with any Order Form, constitute the complete and exclusive statement of the parties’ agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous proposals, representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings relating to the same. If any sentence, clause or other provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, including, but not limited to, any limitation of liability, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining clauses and provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby. The affected provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to render it enforceable while attempting to closely approximate the intent and the economic effect of the affected provision.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
